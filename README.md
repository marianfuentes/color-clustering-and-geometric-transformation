# color-clustering-and-geometric-transformation
This repository allows to perform color segmentation using clustering. It also calculates the intra-cluster sum and shows the corresponing histogram. This can be found at ColorSeg.py file.

The second part allows to apply geometric transformation to an image using Affine Transform. Then, it approximates the transformation by applying Similarity Transformation.
